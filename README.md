# Stabilization-Generator

Most deforestation monitoring programs are based on optical images, which are severely affected by clouds, especially in tropical regions. As an alternative, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are little affected by atmospheric conditions. However, one of the challenges inherent in such approaches is the effect of  seasonal rainforest variations over the SAR images. Recently proposed stabilization algorithms mitigate this effect with significant accuracy gains, however, at the cost of higher computational resources, needed to accommodate long temporal  SAR image sequences. This letter addresses this issue and proposes two alternative solutions that attain similar or better accuracy at a much lower computational requirements. One proposed solution is based on a ResUnet, while the second combines an LSTM and a UNet. Experiments have indicated that both approaches can mitigate the seasonality effect using a much shorter SAR image sequences than modern stabilization methods require.
In particular, the ResUnet results with the multitemporal input outperformed those with the preprocessed bitemporal set by 6.1\% in Recall, 3.7\% in Precision, and 6.1\% and F1-Score, also delivering the best deforestation probability maps.
